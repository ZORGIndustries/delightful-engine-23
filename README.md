# delightful engine n.23

ZORG’s Industrials. Engine 23 is an engine for a blockchain perma-world where your mood changes the weather, spawns gods, and rewrites the map.
It’s a resonance powered book you have to play to read, coded in ritual, and open to co-creation.
Fully on-chain. Emotionally sticky. Built to haunt.
